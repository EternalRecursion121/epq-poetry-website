", "body": "Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer\u2019s lease hath all too short a date;\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature\u2019s changing course untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander\u2019st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st:\n\u00a0\u00a0 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\u00a0\u00a0 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n"}}
