Remember that poetry often takes abstract concepts and molds them into tangible imagery and symbolism. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. Distrust of Technology: Write a poem discussing how we trust (or do not trust) technology in our lives, focusing on the constant level of uncertainty that is associated with technology's role in our society.\n\n2.
