And maybe you are the driver\nwith both hands on the wheel, humming a tune\nnobody's ever heard before,\n\nor maybe the woman on the edge of the porch,\ngrown quiet from fleeing,\ntough as nails.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Soldier", "view_node": "/poem/soldier-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/rupert-brooke\" hreflang=\"und\">Rupert Brooke</a>", "field_date_published": "1914", "body": " <pre>If I should die, think only this of me:\n   That there's some corner of a foreign field\nThat is for ever England.
