The war is on your hips.\u00a0\nYour hands. You wear it all over. You wrap\u00a0\nyour hair in it. Pluck it from your eyebrows.\u00a0\nThe rooftop is wide and caring, too rained\u00a0\nor sometimes incensed, and you never once\u00a0\nthink to be afraid of what could arrow a cloud\u00a0\nand kill it.
